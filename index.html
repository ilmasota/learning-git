    <h1>The Albatross</h1>
    <h4>by Charles Baudelaire</h4>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        Often, to amuse themselves, sailors<br>
        snare that great seabird, the albatross,<br>
        that flies with these indolent companions as their ship<br>
        glides over the depths of boredom and despair.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Once they have set their captive on the deck,<br>
        the king of the sky, awkward and in shame,<br>
        piteously drags along his great white wings,<br>
        like idle oars bouncing useless on the foam.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        The winged voyager looks foolish now and weak-<br>
        yesterday he was beautiful; today, ugly and ridiculous.<br>
        One tries to force a burning pipe into his beak.<br>
        Another mimes the limp of one that used to fly.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Poet resembles this prince from the clouds:<br>
        Each hangs in the tempest and laughs at the archer,<br>
        and finds his exile in a circle of hooting humans<br>
        where his wide wings are impediments.<br>
      </p>
